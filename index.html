            <h2>My First Git File</h2>
        </div>
        <p>This is my first file in my new Git Repository</p>
        <p>The first file feels good</p>

        <h3>More changes</h3>
        <p>Here more changes are made, staged and committed</p>
        <p>At first I forgot to write the message, no commits were done as a result.
            But now I know how to stage and commit.
        </p>
        <p>I have read more branch concepts, and one of them is checkout. This enables droping one branch so 
            that you add a feature only to a branch you are checking out to.
            For example this paragraph will only be in 'main' branch since I 'cheked out' of the 'StyledCSS' 
            branch.
