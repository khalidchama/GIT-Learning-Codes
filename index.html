            <h1>My First Git Repository</h1>
            <h2>First use of Git repository</h2>
            <p>This is my first file in my new Git Repository</p>
            <p>The first file feels good</p>

            <h3>More changes</h3>
            <p>Here more changes are made, staged and committed</p>
            <p>At first I forgot to write the message, no commits were done as a result.
                But now I know how to stage and commit.
            </p>
            <p>I have created a branch, but i don't know how to use it</p>
            <p>Now I know how to use the branch. The above paragraph is staged and committed in the branch 
                called "StyledCSS" but is not staged and commited in the branch "main", so the above paragraph 
                is not available in "main" version. Since I branched at 
                the "Removed the styling from this html file and added a link in the head to link it to css file"
                The "main" will end there, it will miss all new features.
            </p>
            <p>This paragraph is staged and commited only in "StyledCSS" branch only. So it misses in the "main".</p>
            <p>That is branch in short. And this paragraph is staged and committed to "main"</p>

            <h3>Git Stash</h3>
            <p>Git stash lets you save your uncommitted changes and return to a clean working directory</p>
            
            <h3>Git History</h3>
            <p>There are commands via Bash, but here I'll be using an extension called 'Git History'</p>
