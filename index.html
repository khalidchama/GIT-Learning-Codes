            <h1>My First Git Repository</h1>
            <h2>First use of Git repository</h2>
            <p>This is my first file in my new Git Repository</p>
            <p>The first file feels good</p>

            <h3>More changes</h3>
            <p>Here more changes are made, staged and committed</p>
            <p>At first I forgot to write the message, no commits were done as a result.
                But now I know how to stage and commit.
            </p>
            <p>I have created a branch, but i don't know how to use it</p>

            <h3>Git Stash</h3>
            <p>Git stash lets you save your uncommitted changes and return to a clean working directory</p>
            
            <h3>Git History</h3>
            <p>There are commands via Bash, but here I'll be using an extension called 'Git History'</p>
            <p>It is important</p>

            <h3>Git Branch</h3>
            <p>I have read more branch concepts, and one of them is checkout. This enables droping one branch so 
                that you add a feature only to a branch you are checking out to.
                For example this paragraph will only be in 'StyledCSS' branch since I 'cheked out' of the 'main'.
                branch.
