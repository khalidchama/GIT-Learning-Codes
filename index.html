            <h2>My First Git File</h2>
        </div>
        <p>This is my first file in my new Git Repository</p>
        <p>The first file feels good</p>

        <h3>More changes</h3>
        <p>Here more changes are made, staged and committed</p>
        <p>At first I forgot to write the message, no commits were done as a result.
            But now I know how to stage and commit.
        </p>
        <p>I have created a branch, but i don't know how to use it</p>
        <p>Now I know how to use the branch. The above paragraph is staged and committed in the branch 
            called "StyledCSS" but is not staged and commited in the branch "main", so the above paragraph 
            is not available in "main" version. But this paragraph is satged and committed to both "main" and 
            "StyledCSS" branch. So both versions will have this paragraph
        </p>
        <p>This paragraph is staged and commited only in "StyledCSS" branch only. So it misses in the "main".</p>
